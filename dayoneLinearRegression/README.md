# Day 1 — Linear Regression from Scratch
## MLIDOMM: Machine Learning Is the Daughter of Mathematics

This project marks **Day 1** of the MLIDOMM challenge, focusing on implementing **Linear Regression purely from mathematical principles**, without using machine learning libraries.

The goal is to bridge **pure mathematics** and **machine learning practice**, aligned with **PG entrance–level concepts**.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Understand Linear Regression as a **least squares optimization problem**
- Derive and implement the **Normal Equation**
- Work strictly with **matrix algebra**
- Build a mini capstone project using Python + NumPy

---


## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Least Squares Method
- Matrix Transpose and Inverse
- Bias Term Augmentation
- Vectorized Computation
- Linear Algebra in ML

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

- Language: **Python**
- Libraries: **NumPy**
- No use of `scikit-learn`
- All vectors treated as **2D matrices** to preserve mathematical correctness
