# Day 2 — Gradient Descent from Scratch
## MLIDOMM: Machine Learning Is the Daughter of Mathematics

This project represents **Day 2** of the MLIDOMM challenge, shifting from closed-form solutions to **calculus-driven learning** using **Gradient Descent**.

The focus is on understanding **how machines learn by minimizing loss functions** through differential calculus.
