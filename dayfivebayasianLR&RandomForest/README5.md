# Day 5 — Bayesian Linear Regression and Random Forest  
### MLIDOMM: Machine Learning Is the Daughter of Mathematics

---

## 📌 Objective

Day 5 explores **two fundamentally different learning paradigms** used in Machine Learning:

1. **Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR)** — a probabilistic, parametric approach that models uncertainty explicitly  
2. **Random Forest (RF)** — an ensemble-based, non parametric approach that reduces variance through averaging

The objective is to understand **how learning happens under uncertainty**, either through **probability theory** or through **ensemble intelligence**.

## PART A — Bayesian Linear Regression

### Motivation

Classical Linear Regression produces a **single point estimate** for parameters

Ridge Regression is the **Maximum A Posteriori estimate** of Bayesian Linear Regression.

## PART B — Random Forest Regression

### Motivation

Decision Trees have:
- Low bias
- High variance

Random Forest reduces variance by combining many decorrelated trees.

## 🔍 Conceptual Contrast

| Aspect | Bayesian LR | Random Forest |
|---|---|---|
| Learning type | Probabilistic | Ensemble based |
| Model | Parametric | Non parametric |
| Uncertainty | Explicit | Implicit |
| Interpretability | High | Low |

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaway

Bayesian Linear Regression models uncertainty through probability,  
while Random Forest reduces uncertainty through ensemble diversity.

Together, they represent two powerful and complementary philosophies of learning.
