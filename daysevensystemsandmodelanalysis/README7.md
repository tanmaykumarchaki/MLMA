# Day 7 — Systems and Model Attributes  
Machine Learning Is the Daughter of Mathematics (MLIDOMM)

## Overview

Day 7 concludes the MLIDOMM challenge by shifting focus from individual algorithms to complete learning systems.  
Instead of asking how a model works, this day addresses why models behave the way they do.

The emphasis is on understanding machine learning models as mathematical systems with inherent attributes such as bias, variance, stability, and capacity. These attributes emerge from structure and assumptions rather than from code alone.

This perspective is essential for building reliable, interpretable, and scalable machine learning pipelines.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Understand machine learning models as systems, not isolated algorithms  
- Analyze model behavior through bias and variance characteristics  
- Relate model capacity to underfitting and overfitting  
- Study stability and sensitivity to data perturbations  
- Connect ML intuition with pure mathematical structure and assumptions

## Core Concepts Covered

### Model as a System
A machine learning model is treated as a transformation system that maps inputs to outputs under fixed assumptions and constraints.

### Bias and Variance
Exploration of how model simplicity and complexity influence systematic error and sensitivity to data.

### Capacity and Expressiveness
Understanding how the representational power of a model impacts learning behavior and generalization.

### Stability
Analysis of how small changes in training data affect predictions and decision making.

### Generalization
Study of how well a model performs on unseen data based on its structural properties.

## Mini Project Description

The mini project for Day 7 focuses on observing system level attributes through controlled experiments.

### Project Goals

- Train a simple model using a structured pipeline  
- Modify data and observe changes in predictions  
- Analyze sensitivity and robustness  
- Interpret results using system attributes rather than performance metrics alone  

### Files Included

- `system_model.py`  
  Implements a clean learning pipeline focused on structural clarity  

- `analysis.py`  
  Evaluates system behavior under different conditions

## Key Takeaways

- Model behavior is dictated more by assumptions than by syntax  
- Good performance does not always imply good system design  
- Mathematical structure determines learning stability and reliability  
- Understanding systems is essential for real world decision making

## Academic Relevance

This day aligns strongly with postgraduate level topics including:

- Statistical learning theory  
- Linear algebra and vector space interpretation  
- Optimization assumptions  
- Bias variance tradeoff  
- Model evaluation beyond metrics

## Challenge Summary

Machine Learning is the Daughter of Mother Mathematics was designed to bridge pure mathematics and machine learning through daily derivation, implementation, and reflection.

Day 7 marks the transition from learning algorithms to thinking like a machine learning architect.
